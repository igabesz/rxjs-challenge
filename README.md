# RxJs Challenge

This is a little stream debugging story of mine.
I wrote a Medium article on the details.

## Requirements & Setup

You'll need Node.js, I tested it with 14.
Probably works with other versions too.

```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

## Run

There are 5 examples. To run the first, type:

```bash
npm start -- 1
```
